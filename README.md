ðŸ‘‹ Hi There ! I am a Software Developer with over 1.5 years of experience refining my craft and delivering impactful solutions. Currently serving as a Software Developer at NCFDC, where I developed a Python script deployed on AWS Lambda, revolutionizing our data entry process and saving 180 hours of work per quarter.

ðŸš€ During my tenure as a Full Stack Developer at Rubicon. I created a web-based Freedom of Information request system utilizing HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Stripe.js, Flask & Twilio API, which facilitated over 1,000 successful requests by users within the first three months. 

ðŸŽ¥ Outside of my professional endeavors, I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences with the broader community.
