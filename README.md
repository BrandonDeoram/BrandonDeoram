<p>I am a fourth year student at Ontario Tech University, working towards achieving a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Outside of work and school, I love to create mobile applications that benefit me and my friends, as well as automating easy tasks using python and other languages. I code for fun in my free time, but there's just so much I want to learn and create, that it's hard choosing one project to focus on. With that said I am looking for something new, where I can put my skills to use and have my work benefit others around me.</p>
