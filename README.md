<p>As a fourth-year computer science student with a focus on mobile and web development, I have gained a strong foundation in programming languages and frameworks such as Flutter, Python, and React. I have a passion for building interactive and user-friendly applications and have gained practical experience through coursework and personal projects. In my internships and coursework, I have had the opportunity to work on projects ranging from developing web pages to building mobile applications. I am excited to continue learning and growing in my skills, and am eager to apply my knowledge and passion to a career in mobile and web development. I am always looking for new opportunities to challenge myself and make a meaningful impact in the industry.

Outside of work, I love to read manga ðŸ“š watch anime, as well as make YouTube videos such as study vlogs, and developer vlogs to document my journey.
